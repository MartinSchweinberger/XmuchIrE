# Overview

This repository contains resources for the book chapter: 

Schweinberger, M. and Patrcia Ronan (fc). *Boring much? Semantic determinants of constructional attraction in Irish English*, in M. Schweinberger and P. Ronan (Eds.), *Socio-Pragmatic Variation in Ireland*, De Gruyter.

## Contents:

1. Processed and de-anonymized data is available in the **data** sub-folder (in both rda and xlsx formats). Please note that the original raw data couldn't be shared due to copyright issues. The raw data for this study was taken from the offline version of the *Corpus of Global Web-Based English* (GloWbE) [International Corpus of English](https://www.english-corpora.org/glowbe/) (see Greenbaum 1991).

2. The **R notebooks** (*AmpHKPhiE_Part01.Rmd* and *AmpHKPhiE_Part02.Rmd*) and the **rendered html versions of the R notebooks** (*AmpHKPhiE_Part01.html* and *AmpHKPhiE_Part02.html*).

3. All figures (in their raw format) used in the publication can be found in the **images** sub-folder.

4. Raw format tables used in the publication are available in the **tables** sub-folder.

5. The language model used for part-of-speech tagging is included as the file *english-ewt-ud-2.5-191206.udpipe*.

6. The R version and all package versions are documented in the rendered R notebooks (at the very end as the output of the `sessionInfo()` call).

## Interactive Jupyter Notebook:

To enhance transparency and reproducibility, we've created an [interactive Jupyter notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MartinSchweinberger/WE_AmpAdj_AsianEnglishes_iA/main?labpath=AmpHKPhiE_Part02_cb.ipynb). This notebook can be accessed by clicking the link or the Binder badge below. It allows for the repetition of the second part of the analysis, which includes:

- Final data cleaning
- Data checking
- Data visualization
- Statistical analysis
- Evaluation of the statistical analysis

**To run the interactive Jupyter notebook:**
1. Click on the first code chunk that activates R packages.
2. Navigate to the *Run* tab once the notebook has started.
3. Select *Run all cells* to execute all code chunks consecutively.
